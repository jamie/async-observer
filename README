This is Async Observer -- a Rails plugin that provides deep integration with
Beanstalk.  It is also a Merb plugin, based on code by Chris Van Pelt.

For more information, see http://async-observer.rubyforge.org/.

For more information on Beanstalk, see its home page at
http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd/.


To load properly in merb, register the dependency in the before_app_loads
hook.  Otherwise, it doesn't know which ORM to use.

Merb::BootLoader.before_app_loads do
  dependency 'async_observer'
end
